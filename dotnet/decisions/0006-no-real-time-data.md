# 6. No Real-Time Data

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project focuses on daily/delayed stock data for research and analysis. Real-time or intraday data would add significant complexity and compliance requirements.

## Decision
Only daily/delayed data is in scope. Real-time or intraday data is explicitly out of scope.

## Consequences
- Simplifies architecture and compliance.
- Reduces infrastructure and operational costs.
- Focuses on research and historical analysis use cases.

## Alternatives Considered
- Real-time data ingestion and processing
