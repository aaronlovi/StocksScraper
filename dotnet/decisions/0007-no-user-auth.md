# 7. No User Authentication/Authorization (for now)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project is in early stages and focused on backend/data processing. User authentication and authorization are not required yet, but may be added in the future.

## Decision
No user logins or authentication/authorization are implemented at this stage. JWT or OAuth may be added in the future as needed.

## Consequences
- Simplifies initial development and deployment.
- Allows focus on core data and ETL features.
- Security features can be added later as requirements evolve.

## Alternatives Considered
- Implement authentication/authorization from the start
