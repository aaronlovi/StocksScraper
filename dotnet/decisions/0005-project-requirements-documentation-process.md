# 5. Project/Requirements Documentation Process

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Clear, consistent, and up-to-date requirements and documentation are essential for effective planning, collaboration, and traceability.

## Decision
All projects and features must start with a requirements document that includes:
- A table of requirements (ID | Requirement | Description | Status | Notes)
- Kanban-style task list (separate section)
- High-level design
- Technical design
- Implementation context and codebase helpers (from codebase inspection)
- Implementation hints

## Consequences
- Ensures clarity, planning, and traceability for all work.
- Facilitates onboarding and review.
- Reduces risk of missing requirements or context.

## Alternatives Considered
- Ad-hoc requirements
- No formal process
