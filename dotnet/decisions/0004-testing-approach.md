# 4. Testing Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Automated and behavior-driven testing is required to ensure reliability and maintainability. The approach must support .NET, cover all features, and be easy to maintain.

## Decision
xUnit is used for unit testing, and Gherkin/SpecFlow (or similar) is used for behavior-driven (BDD) scenarios.

## Consequences
- Ensures all features are covered by automated tests and scenarios.
- Supports .NET best practices and community standards.
- Facilitates regression testing and documentation of user-facing behaviors.

## Alternatives Considered
- MSTest
- NUnit
- Manual testing
