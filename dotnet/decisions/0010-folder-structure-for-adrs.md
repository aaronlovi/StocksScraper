# 10. Folder Structure for ADRs

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) must be organized for easy discovery, navigation, and maintenance.

## Decision
Store all ADRs in a `decisions` folder at the solution root. Maintain a running `README.md` in the folder that links to each ADR and provides an index.

## Consequences
- Ensures ADRs are easy to find and reference.
- Supports project documentation and onboarding.
- Keeps architectural history organized and accessible.

## Alternatives Considered
- Scattered ADRs in various folders
- No index/README
